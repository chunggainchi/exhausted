          <p className="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg">
            Hi, I&apos;m Sharon â€” a Germany-based mum to three-year-old daughter, my resident question factory and chief product tester. When she asks, &quot;Can we buildâ€¦?&quot; my default setting is yes, because making things â€” songs, sketches, cardboard contraptions, videogames, foam palaces, you name it â€” is the fuel that keeps me going.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg">
            This site is my caffeine-powered logbook. I&apos;d be doing most of these projects anyway; writing them down turns the normally invisible work of &quot;raising tiny monkeys&quot; into a stack of visible wins that makes us both proud.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base sm:text-lg">
            I call the blog &quot;Exhausted Rocket.&quot; In rocketry, a vehicle can outrun the speed of its own exhaust as long as it keeps throwing mass backwards. Parenting feels the same: pour in brain-juice, love and late-night hot glue, and your little rocket eventually zooms faster and farther than the tired booster who launched her. That&apos;s the plan â€” even if I&apos;m wiped out, she&apos;ll have all the momentum she needs. ðŸš€
