## Let's Build a Castle!

Those interlocking plastic puzzle mats aren't just for the floor! With a little imagination, they can become the building blocks for an awesome play castle.

### What You'll Need:

*   A good number of square puzzle mats (at least 16-20 for a decent size).
*   Toddler architects (optional, but highly encouraged).

### Step 1: Build the Walls

Start by connecting four mats into a square base on the floor. Then, build upwards! Connect mats vertically to create walls. You can make them as tall as you like, but 2-3 mats high is usually stable enough.

*Tip: If your mats have edge pieces, remove them for easier vertical connection.*

### Step 2: Add Towers (Optional)

For extra flair, you can make corner towers. Try making a 2x2 mat square on the floor next to a corner, and build that section higher than the main walls.

### Step 3: Create Doorways and Windows

Leave gaps in the walls as you build to create entrances and windows. You can make arches by carefully connecting mats at an angle, though simple square openings work just fine.

### Step 4: The Roof (The Tricky Part!)

A full roof is often difficult and unstable. Here are some ideas:

*   **Open Top:** Just leave it open!
*   **Partial Roof:** Create a small overhang over one section.
*   **Fabric Roof:** Drape a light blanket or sheet over the top (make sure it's secure).

### Step 5: Decorate and Play!

Bring in pillows, blankets, stuffed animals, and toys. Your castle is ready for royal adventures!

```
// Example code block just for show
function play() {
  console.log("Castle construction complete!");
}
```

Enjoy your new puzzle mat kingdom!
